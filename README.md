Just run the application and it should work if you are using both reality runner + xbox one controller and are on linux.

If you are not using an xbox controller just run the application and pass the name of the controller as such "./app 'Playstation Controller I Guess'" and it should work.

If you don't know your controller name try getting evtest and running evtest to see what is the name of your controller.
